# Carl Character Image

**IMPORTANT:** Place the Carl character image (carl.png) in this directory.

The image you provided showing Carl the purple octopus-slug-urchin should be saved as:
```
Internal-Games/slop/carl/carl.png
```

## Image Requirements

- **Filename:** `carl.png`
- **Format:** PNG with transparent background (recommended) or JPG
- **Recommended size:** 512x512 pixels or larger
- **Content:** The purple slug-urchin character with tentacles

## Where It's Used

1. **Title Screen** (`index.html`): Displays as the main character showcase
   - Animated with floating effect
   - Size: 300x300px (will scale automatically)

2. **Favicon** (optional): Can be used as browser tab icon

## Alternative

If you don't have the image file yet, you can:
1. Save the image from your chat attachment
2. Name it `carl.png`
3. Place it in the `Internal-Games/slop/carl/` directory

The game will still run without the image, but the title screen will show a broken image icon where Carl should appear.
